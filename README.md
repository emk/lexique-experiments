# French Vocabulary Frequency with Lexique

[Lexique 3](http://lexique.org/) is a French word database from the
Universit√© de Savoie.  SQLite 3 is a fast, local database.  IPython is a
cool way to work with and visualize scientific data.

I'm also merging in the [French verb conjugation rules][fvcr] data set,
which will provide detailed information about regular verbs.

[fvcr]: http://sourceforge.net/projects/fvcr/

## Viewing the notebook online

[A notebook with lots of interesting data][nb] is available via nbviewer.
